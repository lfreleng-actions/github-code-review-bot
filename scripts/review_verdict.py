"""Classify a Copilot review of a pull request head, offline.

The organisation's definition (AGENTS.md section 11.5): a review of
the head is **clean** when there is no unresolved review thread, no
suppressed finding in the overview, and the assessment is
``🟢 Approval recommended`` (``🟢 Ready to approve`` in older
reviews) or ``🔵 Needs a closer look``. ``🟡 Changes recommended``
is always **findings**, as is a body with no assessment at all,
which is what the older ``## Pull request overview`` format has. A
review that never arrived is **pending**.

The body is text from outside the pipeline. It is read to a bound,
with fixed patterns, after fenced code is removed, and the record
holds labels and counts alone, never the text.
